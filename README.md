### Biki/Becky Pennock - Front End Developer 🐝🗝️

Hi there! I'm a developer who got their start in notepad making fun fandom websites as a kid and I kept falling down more and more code rabbitholes. I code for the same reason people play Super Meat Boy -- there's satisfaction in getting something after working to get there.

I'm a maker through and through. I've been a professional concept/technical artist, amateur woodworker, I'm a chaos gremlin in the kitchen. I enjoy knowing _why_ things work the way they do and I'm endlessly engaging in ways to create.

My professional work is all on private repos, so this is my playground for public/personal projects. Feel free to check out my codepen while you're poking around here:
